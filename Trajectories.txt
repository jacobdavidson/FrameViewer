Mode 1: Trajectory building:

A marker along a trajectory has the following properties:
	activity: enum { NotCarrying, CarryingFood, CarryingSomethingElse }

A trajectory has the following properties:
	moveType: enum { Unknown, Ascending, Descending }

To start a trajectory: Left click
	A marker is created with the user's selected ant ID and activity
To add more points to the trajectory:
	Left click. A marker will be created with the same ID and attributes as the last one, continuing the active trajectory.
To add a point to the trajectory and change its attributes:
	Shift+left click activates a dialog that allows the user to choose the attributes of that point, and to finalize the trajectory
To add an interaction marker to the trajectory:
	(UI TBD)
	The software searches for a nearby interaction marker.
	A dialog appears, asking the user to enter the ID of the met ant
		If a nearby interaction marker has been found, the ID of that ant, and the interaction type if it is available, are pre-filled.
	The user can change the information.
	Once the dialog is closed, the interaction marker is created.
		If a nearby interaction marker was found, the two are formally associated.



A later step: A separate fragment that displays the interactions that do not have known other ants
